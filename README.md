## Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [University of Melbourne](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-institutes/centre-for-health-policy/research-group/cancer-health-unit), where I combine my passions for cancer research, data science, and public health to make a positive impact on the world. 

My professional journey bridges the gap between clinical medicine and data science to enhance public health outcomes, particularly in the realm of cancer care. 
I leverage linked data sources collected in various forms within the healthcare continuum to improve precision medicine for cancer patients and reduce the burden of disease. My goal is to generate actionable clinical insights, inform healthcare policies, and improve treatment equity.

### About me üî¨
> üìå Job: senior data scientist specialised in clinical and digital health at the Cancer Health Services Research Unit. <br>

> üí° Interests: treatment patterns, inequities in access and provision of care, consumer & research partnership, predictive modelling, health economics. <br>

> üî≠ Background: I earned my PhD in Clinical Medicine, where I explored the role of immunity & tumour microenvironment in colorectal cancer. Today, my research focuses on harnessing population based linked-datasets to improve cancer care and public health. <br>
